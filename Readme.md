## Requirements

This mod requires the "Real car names" that you can find [here](https://github.com/MMike17/ArtOfRally_RealCarNames).\
Latest release [![](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/MMike17/ArtOfRally_RealCarNames?label=Real%20car%20names)](https://github.com/MMike17/ArtOfRally_RealCarNames/releases/latest)

## Usage

Press Ctrl + F10 to open the mod manager menu.\
Adjust settings to select what lock method you want.\
By default, the mod locks every car to their production year in career mode.

"hideLockedInMenu" will hide locked cars in the car selection menu.\
"replaceInLeaderboards" will make sure all racers in the rally will have unlocked cars.

Disabling the mod in the manager will restore the original unlock conditions by default.\
If no cars are available for a season, the mod will default to enableing all cars.

## Disclaimer

There is no UI hot reload.\
Please enable this mod and change settings **before** entering the career menu.

This mod might lock some cars out of career mode entirely.
